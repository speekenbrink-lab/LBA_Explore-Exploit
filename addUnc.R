#1 is simply how long since the option was last picked
#2 is the observed standard deviation on each option across all scores
#3 is the observed standard deviation across all rewards
#4 is the prediction error from the last trial. 
#5 is the Kalman Filter adding to uncertainty 
#6 is the observed SD for all rewards on the last 10 trials (Perhaps make this a parameter later) (Temperature set high before)
