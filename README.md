# LBA_Explore-Exploit

To run simulations:
Open BanditSim.R 
(This will run simulations for a four-armed restless bandit, with reflective barriers at 10 and 40, starting point mean value of 25,
intertrial reward sd drift (innovation) of 2, and trial reward sd of 3)
Set the number of simulations up top desired.
Use 1s or 0s to indicate which simulations to run.
(Simple sim is standard LBA with no uncertainty added, Dual Sim is the two accumulator model with an accumulator for Exploitation and one
for exploration, sdSim is uncertainty impacting the SD of the drift-rate, spSim is the same but for start point). 
Set the params you want up top (there's a guide to what's what in the code)
Set uncertainty style (Commented in the code)
Set learning style (Also commented in the code)
Run all and view graphs.
